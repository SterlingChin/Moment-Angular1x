    <u>Welcome to Moment!</u>
  </p><br>
  <p>
    In the upper left hand corner you'll see the settings cog. In the settings menu you can toggle any one of the elements
    on or off. By default the 7 day forecast is toggled off. This is because you can reach the 7 day forecast by hovering
    over the current weather in the upper right hand corner and then clicking on the "show 7 day forecast" option. </p><br>

    I hope you enjoy Moment! Moment will always be free. If you would like to see specific features added or would like to hire
