    <u>Welcome to Moment!</u>
  </p><br>
  <p>
    Let's get started customizing Moment!<br><br>
    Mouseover the settings cog in the upper left corner. Type in your name and zipcode and click save.  This will now change the greeting and update the weather. <br><br>
    In the settings menu you can toggle any one of the elements
    on or off. By default the 7 day forecast is toggled off. This is because you can reach the 7 day forecast by hovering
    over the current weather in the upper right hand corner and then clicking on the "show 7 day forecast" option. <br><br>
    Access the tutorial again by clicking the "?" in the bottom right.<br><br>
